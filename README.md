### Who I am

For those of you wanting to contribute, nice to meet you, contact me and I'll help you get running.

For those of you browsing, these are the source files for the J2J website - not much to care about, but in case you're interested in helping, shoot me an [email](hamza101muf@outlook.com) or Slack me.

I've also done some other front-end devving & projects @ [hamza101muf.github.io](hamza101muf.github.io) or [@hamzaamufti](tiwtter.com/hamzaamufti)

# To edit locally
This process varies a bit based on whether you're using Mac or Windows - I'm most familiar with Windows which is what I'll be describing:

1. Clone the 'source' branch to your local repository (google if you are confused or ask me) - easiest way to do this is via VSCode under 'Source Control'
2. Go into your file mamanger and locate the files of the repository you just cloned
3. Go to 'src > components > about'
4. Copy the file path (will vary based on the file manager you are using, but looks something like this C:\Users\journey-jannah.github.io\src\components)
5. Open your CLI program
6. type `cd` and then the file path you just copied, then click 'Enter' on your keyboard
7. `npm init react-app my-app`
8. In your local folder, this should create a folder called 'node_modules' if you see it, that means it worked, if not something went wrong
9. Go back to your CLI program (should be the one you were using before, if it's not follow 2 - 6 again) and type `npm start`
10. You can now see the app without publishing it online, use this process to observe changes before you commit them.

# General rules for compiling any new code:
- Make sure you've sent a pull request for the most recent source code when a change is approved to the 'source' branch
- !!!NEVER NEVER NEVER push to 'master' or 'stable' they should *only* be pushed via CLI by me

># Prereqs before you get to coding
>1. Make sure you've been added to the repo as a collaborator
>2. Clone the repo and make sure you only add the 'source' branch as a remote - if you don't know what I'm talking about, Google it.
>3. If you're not accustomed to using code editors, VSCode is pretty popular (and frankly pretty good), it keeps things simple and there is a lot of support for it.
>4. If you're unsure, just ask, it's much easier to change code than it is to debug it, don't push any change until you're 105% sure it won't destroy the app. 🙏
