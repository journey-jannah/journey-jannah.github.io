# This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

For those of you helping to contribute, nice to meet, contact me and I'll help you get running.

For those of you browsing, these are the source files for the J2J website - not much to care about, but in case you're interested in helping, shoot me an [email](hamza101muf@outlook.com)

# General rule for compiling any new code:
- Make sure you've sent a pull request for the most recent source code when a change is approved to the 'source' branch
- DO NOT push to 'master' or 'stable' they have special directions which I will run you through

# Prereqs before you get to coding
1. Make sure you've been added to the repo as a collaborator
2. Clone the repo and make sure you only add the 'source' branch as a remote - if you don't know what I'm talking about Google it.
3. If you're not accustomed to using code editors, VSCode is pretty popular (and frankly pretty good), it keeps things simple and there is a lot of support for it.
4. If you're unsure, just ask, it's much easier to change code than it is to debug it, don't push any change until you 105% sure it won't destroy the machine. üôè
