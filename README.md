### Who I am

For those of you wanting to contribute, nice to meet you, contact me and I'll help you get running.

For those of you browsing, these are the source files for the J2J website - not much to care about, but in case you're interested in helping, shoot me an [email](hamza101muf@outlook.com) or Slack me.

I've also done some other front-end devving & projects @ [hamza101muf.github.io](hamza101muf.github.io) or [@hamzaamufti](tiwtter.com/hamzaamufti)

# General rules for compiling any new code:
- Make sure you've sent a pull request for the most recent source code when a change is approved to the 'source' branch
- !!!NEVER NEVER NEVER push to 'master' or 'stable' they should *only* be pushed via CLI by me

># Prereqs before you get to coding
>1. Make sure you've been added to the repo as a collaborator
>2. Clone the repo and make sure you only add the 'source' branch as a remote - if you don't know what I'm talking about, Google it.
>3. If you're not accustomed to using code editors, VSCode is pretty popular (and frankly pretty good), it keeps things simple and there is a lot of support for it.
>4. If you're unsure, just ask, it's much easier to change code than it is to debug it, don't push any change until you're 105% sure it won't destroy the app. 🙏
